                <p>
                    Chance the Rapper is especially fond of his home city, Chicago. He is very active in the community, giving out scholarships, hosting open-mic nights, establishing charities, and lobbying for social change in the local government. Chance recently endorsed the democratic candidate for the mayor of Chicago. His Chicago based charity, Social Works, was created to aid impoverished youth in Chicago to pay their way through school and follow their passions. Unlike many celebrities, Chancellor Bennett actually cares about his community and the well-being of the less fortunate youth throughout Chicago, Illinois.

                    Chancellor Bennett was born April 16, 1993 in Chicago, Illinois. He is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and philanthropist. He has released three solo projects, a mixtape with the band "The Social Experiment", two collaborative Christmas mixtapes with Jeremih (another American singer). Chance's third mixtape, Coloring Book, earned him three Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Album; upon winning, it became the first streaming-only album to win a Grammy Award. His debut album, "Good Ass Job" is set to be released this year. Chance has many musical influences including soul music, gospel music, and even Chicago rapping legend, Kanye West. Chance the Rapper became outwardly Christian after beating addiction to prescription drugs and the birth of his only daughter. He used to reference the many drugs that he took recreationally but since rediscovering his faith, no longer partakes in such activities. He boasts his love for God throughout his recent music with features from the likes of the Chicago Children's Choir and other gospel groups. Chance the Rapper is engaged to his high school sweatheart and mother of his daughter.
